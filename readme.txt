== Description ==

This is a simple plugin with a shortcode that requires users to input their first & last name and email address to get access to a link (which will be emailed to them).  I wrote this plugin one afternoon because a similar plugin lost functionality when one of the plugins it depended on was removed from Wordpress.org for some reason.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Place the [email_link] shortcode on the page you wish the form to appear.
3. Use [email_link email="your@email.com"] if you wish to specify the target email address, otherwise the admin email will be used.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I specify which email address will receive the surveys? =

Use [email_link email="your@email.com"] if you wish to specify the target email address, otherwise the Wordpress admin email will be used.
