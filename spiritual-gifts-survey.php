        <h3>Adding the Spiritual Gifts Survey to a Page</h3>
        All you have to do to get the survey working on your website is include the <code>[spiritual_gifts]</code> shortcode on the page where you wish the survey to appear.
        <h3>Options</h3>
        <p>Use <code>[spiritual_gifts <b>email="your@email.com"</b>]</code> if you wish to specify the target email address, otherwise the admin email <span style="font-style: italic"><?php print get_bloginfo( 'admin_email', 'Display'); ?></span> will be used.</p>
        <p>Use <code>[spiritual_gifts <b>shape="false"</b>]</code> if you wish to disable the S.H.A.P.E. portion of the survey.</p>

        <h4>S.H.A.P.E. Materials</h4>
        S.H.A.P.E. is Saddleback Church's training on using the spiritual gifts.  According to their website, their training is for discovering how your spiritual gifts, heart, abilities, personality, and experiences (S.H.A.P.E.) in life can be used by God to mold you for service.  Erik Rees was commissioned to write this book on their training.<br />
